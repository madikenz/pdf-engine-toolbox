"""Pre-download PaddleOCR PP-OCRv5 models during Docker build.

This avoids ~300 MB download on first request at runtime.
Runs with || true semantics — failure here is non-fatal.

NOTE: Only downloads the core OCR models (_get_paddle_ocr), NOT PPStructureV3.
PPStructureV3 loads PP-Chart2Table (~1.5 GB transformer) which causes OOM
on t3a.medium (4 GB) during both build and runtime. PPStructure models
load lazily on first classify/table request if ever needed.
